        <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Every single product or place today has its own profile on web giving out information about it to the customers and visitors.</li>
            <li>It not only tells the user about its features but also the reviews and ratings given to it by the people who have experienced it.</li>
            <li>This urged us to automate the technique of rating prediction based on reviews and learn about the algorithms behind it.</li>
            <li>The goal of this project is to determine whether a customer should buy that product or not just by looking at the ratings.</li>
            <li>This project can be used to any data set which involves user reviews and can predict its ratings though, some pre-processing could be required.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>The Kaggle dataset “Hotel Reviews Data in Europe” will be used which is provided by the <a href="http://booking.com">booking.com</a>.</li>
            <li>The data set contains 515,000 customer reviews and scoring of 1493 luxury hotels across Europe.</li>
            <li>The data set contains 17 fields like Hotel Name, Average Score, Negative Review, Positive Review, Review Total Negative Word Counts, Review Total Positive Word Counts, Reviewer Score.</li>
            <li>Out of the 17 fields, we will be using Negative Review, Positive Review and Reviewer Score fields.
                <ul>
                    <li>Negative Review: Negative Review the reviewer gave to the hotel. If the reviewer does not give the negative review, then it should be: ‘No Negative’</li>
                    <li>Positive Review: Positive Review the reviewer gave to the hotel. If the reviewer does not give the negative review, then it should be: ‘No Positive’</li>
                    <li>Reviewer Score: Score the reviewer has given to the hotel, based on his/her experience.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The Negative Review and Positive Review will be used as the features and Reviewer Score will be used as targets. The reviews will be converted to count vectors and fed to the model.</li>

        <h3 id="k-nearest-neighbor">k-Nearest Neighbor</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>k Nearest Neighbour clustering (kNN) is a supervised classification technique that looks at the nearest neighbours, in a training set of classified instances, of an unclassified instance in order to identify the class to which it belongs.</p>
        <p>The model for kNN is the entire training dataset. When a prediction is required for a unseen data instance, the kNN algorithm will search through the training dataset for the k-most similar instances.<br>
            The prediction attribute of the most similar instances is summarized and returned as the prediction for the unseen instance.</p>
        <p>The similarity measure is dependent on the type of data. For real-valued data, the Euclidean distance can be used.<br>
            For other types of data such as categorical or binary data, Hamming distance can be used.</p>
        <p>In the case of regression problems, the average of the predicted attribute may be returned.<br>
            In the case of classification, the most prevalent class may be returned.</p>
        <p>The kNN algorithm belongs to the family of instance-based, competitive learning and lazy learning algorithms.</p>
        <p>Instance-based algorithms are those algorithms that model the problem using data instances (or rows) in order to make predictive decisions.<br>
            The kNN algorithm is an extreme form of instance-based methods because all training observations are retained as part of the model.</p>
        <p>It is a competitive learning algorithm, because it internally uses competition between model elements (data instances) in order to make a predictive decision.<br>
            The objective similarity measure between data instances causes each data instance to compete to “win” or be most similar to a given unseen data instance and contribute to a prediction.</p>
        <p>Lazy learning refers to the fact that the algorithm does not build a model until the time that a prediction is required.<br>
            It is lazy because it only does work at the last second. This has the benefit of only including data relevant to the unseen data, called a localized model.<br>
            A disadvantage is that it can be computationally expensive to repeat the same or similar searches over larger training datasets.</p>

            <p>For this algorithm the distance between every instance of the test set has to calculated with every instance of test set, for this we tried using cartesian method, but this causes memory error and also takes a lot of time.

        <h3 id="naive-bayes-classifier">Naive Bayes Classifier</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on <strong>Bayes’ Theorem</strong>. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.</p>
        <p>For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3″ in diameter and as an orange if it is orange, round, and about 2.5″ in diameter . A Naive Bayes classifier considers each of these “features” (red, orange, round , 2.5″ and 3” in diameter) to contribute independently to the probability that the fruit is an apple/orange, regardless of any correlations between features. Features, however, aren’t always independent which is often seen as a shortcoming of the Naive Bayes algorithm and this is why it’s labeled “naive”.</p>
        <p>Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier that makes classifications using the <strong>Maximum A Posteriori</strong> decision rule. Hence, to find posterior probability it will first calculate the prior probability and then likelihood of an object to a particular class.</p>
        <p>Prior probabilities are based on previous experience and often it used to predict outcomes before they actually happen.</p>
        <p>To compute the maximum likelihood for new object, calculate the probability of that object belonging to each class label and class with the highest probability will be chosen as a predicted class for that object.</p>
        <p>In the Bayesian analysis, the final classification is produced by combining both sources of information, i.e., the prior and the likelihood, to form a posterior probability using the Bayes’ rule.</p>

            Since the feature we used is just bag-of-words the accuracy of the models is not high, if other features like word embedding with context window and TF-IDF or if n-grams are used the accuracy of the model can be increased.<br>
            But, the main moto behined this project was to implement the algorithms in a distributed  way, which was accomplished and to verify the corretness of the algorithms, their accuracies were compared with the library versions of the same.<br>
            As we can see from the below screen captures, there is only a difference of around <strong>5%</strong> between the implemented version and the library versions for both the algorithms.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The objective of the project was to predict the rating based on the review and to implement the kNN and Naive Bayes algorithm in a distributed fashion which was accomplished successfully.</li>
            <li>The accuracy of the models could be improved by changing the features used, which is discussed in the future scope.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="future-scope">Future Scope</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Though the algorithms implemented are correct which can be verified from the accuracy of the library version of the same algorithms, the features choosen was not appropriate.</li>
            <li>We can choose better features like TF-IDF and consider bigram and Trigram possibilities and also perform feature union by choosing features like POS tagging and considering the similar words also for the words in the reviews.</li>
            <li>We can package this as a library for use by ecommerce websites.</li>

        <h2 id="challenges-faced">Challenges Faced</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Out of Memory Error was one of the biggest challenges that we faced, to resolve this issue we reduced the memory consumption by each task and also moved the execution of Algorithms from local machine to AWS EMR clustures.
                <ul>
                    <li>For kNN  we used the collect loop insted of cartesian product, which was consuming a lot of memory.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>In AWS EMR we used 1-Master : 2-Slave architecture, at first we installed the necessary packages only in the master instance, but our method of implementation needed the packages to be installed in the slave instances as well, it took a while to figure this out and resolve this issue.</li>
            <li>When trying  to test the data with library implementation, ran out of memory even in EMR, so to parallelize the prediction and for this we had to brod cast the classifier object to the slave nodes.</li>
            <li>Could not find the scikit-learn library in DSBA hadoop cluster</li>
        </ul>
